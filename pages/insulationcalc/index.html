          Use this tool to calculate the differences in efficiency of applying insulation to your room or house. 

          <strong>!This tool is still under construction!</strong>

          <div>
            Height (m):  <input id="roomheight" type="number"/> <br/>
            Width (m): <input id="roomwidth" type="number"/> <br/>
            Depth (m): <input id="roomdepth" type="number"/> <br/>
            Inside Temp (&#176;C): <input id="roominsidetemp" type="number"/> <br/>
            Outside Temp (&#176;C): <input id="roomoutsidetemp" type="number"/> <br/>
          </div>
          <div style="width:100%" id="animation"></div>
          <div>
            Wall/Object: <strong><span id="wallname">Choose a wall</span></strong> (<span id="wallsize">0</span>m<sup>2</sup>)<br/>
            Outside Wall: <input id="wallisoutside" type="checkbox"/><br/>
            R Value: <input id="wallrvalue" type="number"/><br/>
          </div>


          <h4>Results</h4>


          This room has an area of <strong><span id="resultarea"></span>m<sup>2</sup></strong> that it can lose heat directly to the environment.

          You would need to heat the room by <strong><span id="resultwatts"></span> watts</strong> to maintain the inside temp.

          <div>
            <canvas id="chartOfTempChange"></canvas>
          </div>

          <h4>Why are R-Values important?</h4>

          <p>The r-values are important as it defines how much heat can escape out of your room or house. The higher the r-value the less heat that can escape out of your house.</p>

          <p>The r-value is the thermal conductivity of a material (how well it resists the flow of heat).</p>

          <p>Rooms insulated with more material will have a lower thermal conductivity and therefore be cheaper to maintain a comfortable temperature. The savings can add up to large amounts over time.</p>

          <p>If you have no insulation adding some can make a world of difference. For example on a solid double brick wall with a width of 3m and a height of 2.4m will require 96 watts to maintain at 21&#176;C. At gas prices of 7p/kWh that costs 0.7p/hour to keep heated or £61.32/year. By insulating the wall when it was being re-plastered the price has dropped to 0.2p/hour or £18.39/year. Saving £42.93 every year in heating.</p>

          <p>That was just one wall in one room. Insulating more of your house will mean that the savings quickly add up.</p>
          

          <h4>How to use the tool</h4>

          <p>To use this tool enter the values for your house or room. Then use the room to select the walls and set the r-value and if it's an outside wall. (Inside walls are ignored).</p>

          <p>To calculate an r-value for a wall, add up all the layers. For example a double brick layer has an r-value of ~1.2 and plaster has 0.07. Combine these for 1.27.</p>

          <p>To rotate the room please use the arrow keys then click on the rooms values you wish to change.</p>

          <h4>Contribute or issues</h4>

          This tool has had to make some estimations and rough guesses to supply it's answers:


          <ul>
           <li>The tool ignores the heat capacity of the walls themselves and assumes they don't hold any heat.</li>
           <li> Your room may contain vents other ways fresh air can enter this is not calculated.</li>
           <li> This tool only looks at the walls leading directly to the outside. Internal walls are not included in the calculations.</li>
            <li>Currently the tool does not take windows or doors into account.</li>
          </ul>
