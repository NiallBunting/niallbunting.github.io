Liberating structures promise to unleash innovation, creativity and gather great ideas. This post aims to capture a glimpse of my thoughts and feelings on some of the structures. As part of this post I will include a brief overview, however for more information about specific structures see the [liberating structure website][liberatingstructures].

# What are Structures

Structures are the various parts that come together to make a workplace. These are split into both 'Macrostructures', 'Microstructures' and 'Structural elements'.
* Macrostructures are the core operating model, buildings and strategy of the business - these are often large and slow moving.
* Microstructures are the smaller parts such as meeting rooms, brainstorm and discussions - this is where and how discussions take place.
* Structural elements are used by the microstructures to facilitate and are things such as whiteboards, time allocations and agendas.

As you may have noticed the structures above include both tangible and intangible elements. All these sections play an important role as each one above relies on the smaller elements coming together, as each can often lead to different solutions being presented. These solutions will then cause 

When we refer the structures below we are talking about here are the intangible microstructures and how we can add to the often small repository we have.

## Conventional Structures

There are five main structures that people use these are the following:
* Presentations
* Status Reports
* Managed Discussions
* Open Discussions
* Brainstorms

With the first three being inhibiting as they don't allow everyone to get involved and often restrict the involvement to a small amount of people. And the final two being too loose and disorganised to drive actual outcomes. 

## Liberating Structures

These are new structures that offer alternatives to the structures mentioned above. There use cases differ and to find specific information on each one have a look at the liberating structures website. For each one they include an invitation, how to do use the structure, why to use the structure and tips and tricks.

# The Experiences

This post is going to evolve over time as I manage to try working with more of the structures, some may be from the view of a participant others as the facilitator.
