This page offers a download to a Max OS X version of the Dvorak keyboard layout with UK punctuation.

This was inspired by the following [tarind.com][tarind].

This bundle was created using the [Ukelele tool][ukelele].

I'm using this on macOS Mojave (10.14.6).

Hopefully this makes your life a little easier by not having to create it yourself.
