This page offers a download to a Max OS X version of the Dvorak keyboard layout with UK punctuation.

This was inspired by the following [tarind.com][tarind].

This bundle was created using the [Ukelele tool][ukelele].

I was using this on macOS Mojave (10.14.6), now Catalina (10.15.7).

Hopefully this makes your life a little easier by not having to create it yourself.

**[Download][download]**

MD5: f1d2779e933f142c6a1b52b3504b678d (Updated 03/2020 - This keyboard now works with caps lock pressed).

## Installation Instructions

Just drop the file into the `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` directory. Then enable it through the settings.
