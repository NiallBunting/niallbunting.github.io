The just in time (JIT) idea came from manufacturing where a part would not be manufactured until it was needed. Can we take these lean ideas of waste and apply them to knowledge?

_It got a bit late and I didnt manage to proof read this. Will do it tommorow._

JIT knowledge, means not knowing the knowledge until the point that you need it. This is especially possible nowadays as the internet has vast streams of information, just seconds away. Meaning it's much more practical to just look up the information on demand. 

## Sources non-JIT

### Childhood

I think I need to mention one of the largest sources of non-JIT in our life and that is education. I think early primary school is actually JIT friendly because learning maths, how to write etc. takes time which is needed at this stage of life to be able to interact in the world.

I suppose first source of high levels of high non-JIT information is secondary school which covers a broader set of topics. It depends on your school but I covered topics such as literature, history, foreign language, electronics alongside the core subjects (maths, English and science).

Next is university, which narrows the scope considerably but takes an even more in-depth view at that narrow slice, looking at sub-topics within the field.

### Later Life

Much information is passively received as an adult that doesn’t actually have much impact on the way you go about your life day to day. For example, the most of the news doesn’t have a measurable impact on your day to day life.

There are also aspects of non-JIT in the workplace, for example meetings to show how a certain sub-system works when you don't interact with it. Or long email chains that you're included in that are not relevant.

I’m sure you can think of many more examples of both work and non-work.

## Gists

### Memory

There are some memory effects to talk about here:
There are two types of knowledge here the idea of the ‘gist’ of the knowledge and the direct facts and figures. For example I can remember that Milgram’s experiment uses a shocking box and many people will follow the authority, but I can’t remember numbers of participants or the variations that he did. This is sometimes called the verbatim effect from Fuzzy-Trace theory.

Context effects that ideas in context are much easier to remember than memories that are currently out of context. This is why you can remember something after someone has mentioned a triggering aspect.

### What this means

Of the knowledge gained in education, small amounts are remembered verbatim, with more being remembered as gist, then we have the context effects and finally just forgotten information.

With that gist in place it’s much easier to come back to the information at a later stage and parse it again and bring more of the knowledge back into the fray. Coming back to the information can actually make it make much more sense the previous times that you have tried to learn a concept. This happened to me as a child I couldn’t wrap my head around why you would ever use pointers, I spent days trying to work out why you would use them. Came back a few years later and it was so obvious why you wouldn’t want to pass massive pieces of information about.

This is an important thing to note as when people says learning about X was pointless at school as they can’t remember it any more, they are actually showing that they do remember that aspect. And could refresh their memory if needs be.

## Non-jit needs to be a gist

Non-JIT information needs to be information that is gistable. If it’s gistable then people will remember that. However, if it’s some detailed analysis then it’s not worth doing as people are not going to rember those items.

It’s just not useful to have detailed non-jit information as it will not be commited to memory with any great reliability.

## Can we use JIT and the internet instead

I think one of the strongest problems is that many ideas come out from combining ideas from different disciplines in an interesting way to create a hybrid solution. For example, this post, combining the JIT ideas from manufacturing and exploring applying them to knowledge.

With the JIT framework you don’t know about that other idea to even search for it. Unless we upgrade our suggestions to such an extend that computers can make those inferences for us.

This is what makes all those early investments so important they build up your banks of gists that you may need in the future. You have many books to pull from if needed and at that stage nobody knows what you need or not. I didn’t expect to ever end up using the stats I learnt but only the other day I was implementing those exact equtations.

This means to effectively come up with ideas we need large banks of gists and once we have a gist we can bring back the context specific information by doing research to bring that data back into the forefront of our minds.
