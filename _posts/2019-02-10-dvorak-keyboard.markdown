This prompted me to make this blog. As I didn't really think the current place for the dvorak keyboard was the right place.


This page offers a download to a Microsoft Windows built version of the Dvorak keyboard layout with UK punctuation (I used Windows 10).


The download file is built following the instructions at [tarind.com][tarind].

I have shared this keyboard layout, to ease the pain of creating the keyboard on each new windows machine. As this means you don't need to download the keyboard creation tool.
