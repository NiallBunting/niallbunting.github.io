One ingredient challenge is a month long challenge where you only eat foods containing one single ingredient.

This means any food items with exactly one ingredient on the package is fine, any with an ingredients list longer that one is disallowed. The challenge aims to make me more conscious of the food I eat. This has already thrown up a surprise that one of my Fajita mixes main ingredient is [Maltodextrin][maltodextrin] a thickener, it's not even spice!

I am allowed to process food myself. For example I can't buy bread from the shop but can make it at home. As long as all the ingredients that go into the item are single foods that I can hold in my hand.

Since I don't fancy not cleaning my teeth I'm going to have an exception for toothpaste and mouthwash. Not that I eat them! Just including here for completeness.

This blog post is going to chart my progress with what I'm eating. I'm no chef and am going to stay simple and easy. I'm not going to include drinks which are going to consist of water, tea and coffee.

## Food Diary

**Thoughts:** I didn't consider breakfast much until today, porridge on it's own is a bit bland therefore will need to spice it up after a few days. Also discovered that soy sauce always contains multiple ingredients, so am unable to use it in a stir fry. The curry was really nice, I wouldn't have known that it was from my spice draw, if I hadn't made it.

##### 2nd Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* Leftover Coriander Chicken Curry (leftover curry, rice).
* Salad, Cheese and Eggs (leftover salad, cheese, eggs, salt).

**Thoughts:** An easy day as eating the leftovers from the previous day.

* Fajita Spice (cumin, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, fresh coriander).

**Thoughts:** I made my own Fajita seasoning today, as mentioned in the introduction my usual contains mainly Maltodextrin. It was hotter than usual and gave a good flavour profile, I will be using this again. I discovered a couple of things that I can't use today. Firstly, instant yeast, which isn't too surprising. Secondly most flours as they are fortified, with the only exception wholemeal flour, due to the law in the UK. And finally, I discovered that my salt has an anti-caking agent (Sodium Ferrocyanide) so will find an alternative.

##### 4th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk, banana).
* Vegetable Omelette (egg, butter, cheese, carrot, onion, cabbage, chili, broccoli).

**Thoughts:** Continued to use up ingredients in the fridge. I have noticed that my weight is dropping, so will be interested to see if that continues.

##### 5th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk, banana).
* Vegetable Omelette (egg, butter, cheese, carrot, cabbage, broccoli, tomato, pepper, salt).
* Steak and Chips (Steak, salt, pepper, broccoli, potatoes, oregano, paprika, chilli flakes, olive oil, vegetable oil).
* Scones (Wholemeal flour, cornflour, baking soda, brown sugar, butter, milk, sugar, banana).

**Thoughts:** The recipe I used for the scones called for 4 tsp of baking powder, turns out what I have is baking soda so the first batch had a really bad aftertaste of baking soda. They rose really nicely though. Today I was really hungry all throughout the day, I felt like I had to eat more to stay satisfied.
