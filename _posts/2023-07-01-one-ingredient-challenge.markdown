One ingredient challenge is a month long challenge where you only eat foods containing one single ingredient.

This means any food items with exactly one ingredient on the package is fine, any with an ingredients list longer that one is disallowed. The challenge aims to make me more conscious of the food I eat. This has already thrown up a surprise that one of my Fajita mixes main ingredient is [Maltodextrin][maltodextrin] a thickener, it's not even spice!

I am allowed to process food myself. For example I can't buy bread from the shop but can make it at home. As long as all the ingredients that go into the item are single foods that I can hold in my hand.

Since I don't fancy not cleaning my teeth I'm going to have an exception for toothpaste and mouthwash (and medicine). Not that I eat them! Just including here for completeness.

This blog post is going to chart my progress with what I'm eating. I'm no chef and am going to stay simple and easy. I'm not going to include drinks which are going to consist of water, tea and coffee.

## Food Diary

##### 1st Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* 2 * Boiled Egg (egg, salt).
* Salad (pepper, tomato, carrot, cabbage, broccoli, onion, red wine vinegar, olive oil, sesame seeds).
* Coriander Chicken Curry (rice, vegetable oil, chicken, onion, potato, pepper, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, cinnamon powder, fresh coriander, salt, green chilli, tomato, water, cornflour).

**Thoughts:** I didn't consider breakfast much until today, porridge on it's own is a bit bland therefore will need to spice it up after a few days. Also discovered that soy sauce always contains multiple ingredients, so am unable to use it in a stir fry. The curry was really nice, I wouldn't have known that it was from my spice draw, if I hadn't made it.

##### 2nd Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* Leftover Coriander Chicken Curry (leftover curry, rice).
* Salad, Cheese and Eggs (leftover salad, cheese, eggs, salt).

**Thoughts:** An easy day as eating the leftovers from the previous day.

##### 3rd Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* Fajita Spice (cumin, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, fresh coriander).
* Chicken Fajitas (vegetable oil, chicken, onion, pepper, fajita spice, wraps(wholemeal flour, salt, vegetable oil), salsa(tomato, salt, pepper, basil), leftover salad, cheese).
* Fajita chicken rice bowl (fajita leftovers, rice, cheese).

**Thoughts:** I made my own Fajita seasoning today, as mentioned in the introduction my usual contains mainly Maltodextrin. It was hotter than usual and gave a good flavour profile, I will be using this again. I discovered a couple of things that I can't use today. Firstly, instant yeast, which isn't too surprising. Secondly most flours as they are fortified, with the only exception wholemeal flour, due to the law in the UK. And finally, I discovered that my salt has an anti-caking agent (Sodium Ferrocyanide) so will find an alternative.

##### 4th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk, banana).
* Vegetable Omelette (egg, butter, cheese, carrot, onion, cabbage, chili, broccoli).

</div>

**Thoughts:** Continued to use up ingredients in the fridge. I have noticed that my weight is dropping, so will be interested to see if that continues.

##### 5th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk, banana).
* Vegetable Omelette (egg, butter, cheese, carrot, cabbage, broccoli, tomato, pepper, salt).
* Steak and Chips (steak, salt, red pepper, broccoli, potatoes, oregano, paprika, chilli flakes, olive oil, vegetable oil).
* Scones (wholemeal flour, cornflour, baking soda, brown sugar, butter, milk, sugar, banana, clotted cream).

**Thoughts:** The recipe I used for the scones called for 4 tsp of baking powder, turns out what I have is baking soda so the first batch had a really bad aftertaste of baking soda. Really nice rise though! Today I was really hungry all throughout the day, I felt like I had to eat more to stay satisfied.

##### 6th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk, yogurt).
* Peach
* Coffee (coffee, water, milk).
* Chilli con carne with rice and wedges (steak mince, tomatoes, chilli, chilli powder, cumin, onion, pepper, garlic, rice, potato, oregano, chilli flakes, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, vegetable oil).
* Yogurt with a spoon of jam (yogurt, strawberries, raspberries, sugar, cornflour).

**Thoughts:** The coffee was bought from a shop, which gave me mixed feelings under the rules of the challenge. After discussion I decided, since it's simple and one ingredient foods being directly prepared for me, it's okay within the rules. This was my first dish using dry red kidney beans, upon checking online how to cook them i found raw beans contain a lectin [Phytohaemagglutinin][phytohaemagglutinin] which causes mild/serious symptoms if raw beans are eaten. Therefore, I made sure I cooked the beans well. Also searched for some coco powder but could only find it with acidity regulators such as Potassium Hydroxide and Potassium Carbonate.

##### 7th Jul

* Leftover chilli con carne (leftover chilli con carne).
* Fruit (easy peeler, banana, mango).
* Fish and salad (sea bass, rice, red kidney beans, broccoli, coriander, red cabbage, salt, pepper, carrot, red pepper, carrot, almonds, olive oil, onion, red wine vinegar, vegetable oil, tomato).
* Scones (wholemeal flour, cornflour, baking soda, brown sugar, butter, milk, clotted cream, homemade jam).

**Thoughts:** It was a hot day today, would have been nice to go to the pub for a pint after finishing our walk. The spices that I bought that contain a single spice have more taste then the regular supermarket spices I buy. I think i'm going to buy those instead in future.

##### 8th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* Pancakes (flour, egg, milk, vegetable oil, butter, homemade jam, maple syrup, lemon, banana, sugar).
* Falafel Wraps (flour, vegetable oil, dried chickpeas, fresh coriander, ground coriander, salt, black pepper, onion, garlic, cumin, yogurt, cucumber, lemon, red cabbage, lettuce, avocado, tomato, cheese, leftover salad).

**Thoughts:** Looking around the shops I noticed that kefir contains 'Milk, Live Cultures of Kefir Bacteria'. Whereas yogurt and cheese, according to the packs I buy, only contain the respective single ingredient. Even though both contain cultures of their own. Therefore, some products must be able to not list ingredients. Since my arbitrary line in the sand was the ingredient list, they are okay in this challenge, but it makes me wonder what isn't listed.

##### 9th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* Leftovers (eggs, leftover salad, leftover falafel, potato, oil, chilli flakes, oregano, smoked paprika, salt, pepper).

**Thoughts:** Wasn't feeling too hungry today after the large meal yesterday. For my evening meal ate various leftovers from the fridge.

##### 10th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk, yogurt).
* Fried Egg (egg).
* Easy Peeler ('a cross-breed of satsumas and clementines').
* Vegetable Omelette (egg, butter, carrot, broccoli, chilli, onion, carrot, red cabbage, cheese, salt, pepper).
* Yogurt and Jam (yogurt, homemade jam).
* Chicken and Vegetables (potato, chicken, carrot, broccoli, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, cumin, chilli flakes, basil, salt, pepper).

**Thoughts:** Well, looks like my body was balancing out yesterday. I have never searched for what 'easy peelers' are turns out they are a cross-breed of satsumas and clementines, that are easy to peel. Another way that humans shape the world. I've heard there used to be 100's of types of apple that for various reasons are not as easy to farm or as tasty so you don't see them anymore in the supermarket.

##### 11th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* No Bake Oat Cookies (leftover no bake oat cookies).
* Bubble and squeak (potato, red cabbage, onion, broccoli, carrot, garlic, leftover chicken, salt, pepper).

* Scones (wholemeal flour, cornflour, baking soda, brown sugar, butter, milk, clotted cream, homemade jam).

**Thoughts:** I forgot to take a picture of the porridge. Been stacking on those leftover oat cookies, probably ate a few too many. It seems my meals have been using the same carrot, broccoli, red cabbage and onion combination. That's whats in the fridge.

##### 12th Jul

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk, banana).

**Thoughts:** I have been creating a sourdough starter mix, as I can't find single ingredient yeast. It's a few days from being ready for baking bread but decided to give baking a go with the discard. Creating the dense bread that you see above.

##### 13th Jul

* Jam Toast (sourdough bread, homemade jam, butter).
* Omelette (eggs, red kidney beans, onion, broccoli, cheese, sunflower oil).
* Sourdough Pancake (sourdough starter, cornflour, milk, honey, sugar, butter, clotted cream, sunflour oil).

</div>

**Thoughts:** I do wonder looking back through my foods if my foods are a bit 'beige'. Lots of stuff the same colour.

* Porridge (porridge oats, milk).
* Pork Stir Fry (pork, cayenne peeper, chilli powder, oregano, honey, chilli, carrot, ginger, garlic, broccoli, bean sprouts, red cabbage, mushrooms, cornflour, salt, pepper, sunflour oil, sesame oil, seseme seeds).

**Thoughts:** Tried to be a bit less beige today with a stir fry. Bought a lots of vegetables from the shop today for both the salad and stir fry. I think i'll be having a stir fry again tomorrow night. My friend had some fish and chips from the chippy and it smelt particularly nice but stayed strong.

**Thoughts:** Found some wild blackberries. Will go collecting them soon as they are starting to ripe. Enjoying my stirfrys. I am planning to make my first proper sourdough bread over the next few days. As have been using the sourdough starter discard. I wanted some soy sauce on my stir fry tonight.
