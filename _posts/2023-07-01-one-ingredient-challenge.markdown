One ingredient challenge is a month long challenge where you only eat foods containing one single ingredient.

This means any food items with exactly one ingredient on the package is fine, any with an ingredients list longer that one is disallowed. The challenge aims to make me more conscious of the food I eat. This has already thrown up a surprise that one of my Fajita mixes main ingredient is [Maltodextrin][maltodextrin] a thickener, it's not even spice!

I am allowed to process food myself. For example I can't buy bread from the shop but can make it at home. As long as all the ingredients that go into the item are single foods that I can hold in my hand.

Since I don't fancy not cleaning my teeth I'm going to have an exception for toothpaste and mouthwash. Not that I eat them! Just including here for completeness.

This blog post is going to chart my progress with what I'm eating. I'm no chef and am going to stay simple and easy. I'm not going to include drinks which are going to consist of water, tea and coffee.

**Thoughts:** I didn't consider breakfast much until today, porridge on it's own is a bit bland therefore will need to spice it up after a few days. Also discovered that soy sauce always contains multiple ingredients, so am unable to use it in a stir fry. The curry was really nice, I wouldn't have known that it was from my spice draw, if I hadn't made it.
